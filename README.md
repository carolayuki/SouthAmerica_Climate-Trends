# South America Climate Trend

In this project I worked in a group to find factors that cause climate changes in South America. We collected data from open data sources and used Python to wrangle and manipulate the data we needed; Then, we conducted an exploratory analysis on Tableau and showcased the correlation between land usage, CO2 and temperature.

We concluded that land usage and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased the amount of CO2, causing warmer winters overtime.

1. Data wrangling with Python using Jupyter NB
2. A link to the Tableau Visualisation.
